VGUI for Half-Life source, special thanks to Hds46 for the method.

Modified myself the whole menu to make it compatible for Half-life: source.

Tutorial: Drag the script file called "debugoptions" to the Half-life 2 folder, Half-life: source uses the Half-life 2 folder.

Tested on:

- Half-Life:Source

Note:
The definitive edition isn't really definitive, by the way, the anomalous materials map wont work for some reason so It will never really work. You can get the Half-life 2 (ep1, ep2, l-c, etc..)VGUI on ModDB.

Changelog v0.5 DEFINITIVE EDITION :

+ Minor Patches #2
